# NetLogoR

NetLogoR is an R package which aims to help translating agent-based models built in NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999) into R or help directly with creating new agent-based models in R following the NetLogo framework.

NetLogoR provides the necessary NetLogo's primitives as well as complementary functions to build agent-based models. A programming guide derived from the NetLogoâ€™s Programming Guide is available.

This package is under construction and therefore function errors and mismatches with the documentation may occur.

[**Programming Guide**](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/blob/master/vignettes/ProgrammingGuide.Rmd) [https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/blob/master/vignettes/ProgrammingGuide.Rmd](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/blob/master/vignettes/ProgrammingGuide.Rmd)
