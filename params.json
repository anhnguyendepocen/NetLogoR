{"name":"NetLogoR","tagline":"R package for developing Spatial Discrete Event Simulation models.","body":"Master Branch: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR)\r\n\r\nDevelopment Branch: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n# Spatial Discrete Event Simulation (NetLogoR)\r\n\r\n*Develop and run spatially explicit discrete event simulation models.*\r\n\r\nEasily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit agent based models. The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to visualize raster and other maps.\r\n\r\n**Website:** [https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the source tarball (.tar.gz) or windows package binary (.zip):\r\n\r\n+ Current stable release:\r\n    - [Windows binary (.zip)](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/raw/master/NetLogoR_0.4.0.zip)\r\n    - [Source package (.tar.gz)](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/raw/master/NetLogoR_0.4.0.tar.gz)\r\n+ Development version (unstable):\r\n    - [Windows binary (.zip)](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/raw/development/NetLogoR_0.5.0.9000.zip)\r\n    - [Source package (.tar.gz)](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/raw/development/NetLogoR_0.5.0.9000.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, install `NetLogoR` directly from GitHub. You will need the `devtools` package, as well as the appropriate development libraries for your operating system (e.g., Windows users should install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)). In order to build the vignettes from source (which is done when installing a package from GitHub) you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed. We recommend [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).\r\n\r\n    install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n    library(\"devtools\")\r\n\t\r\n    install_github(\"PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR\") # stable\r\n    install_github(\"PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR\", ref=\"development\") # unstable\r\n    \r\nThe suggested package `fastshp` can be installed with:\r\n\r\n    install_github(\"s-u/fastshp\")\r\n\r\nIf the install from GitHub fails during vignette building, you can skip this step (and avoid having to install LaTeX) by using `install_github(\"PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR\", ref=\"development\", build=FALSE)`.\r\n\r\n## Reporting bugs\r\n\r\nContact us via the package GitHub site: [https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/issues](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
