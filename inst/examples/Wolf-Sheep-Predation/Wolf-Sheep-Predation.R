# Wolf sheep predation
# by Wilensky (1997) NetLogo Wolf Sheep Predation model.
# http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation
#
# Converted into R using the NetLogoR package
# by Sarah Bauduin
#
#

## Packages required
#library(NetLogoR)


## Global variables (some represent the model buttons)
# Grass settings
grassOn <- TRUE # TRUE to include grass in the model, FALSE to only include wolves and sheep
grassTGrowth <- 30 # how long it takes for grass to regrow once it is eaten
numGreen <- numeric() # keep track of how much grass there is

# Sheep settings
nSheep <- 100 # initial sheep population size
gainFoodSheep <- 4 # amount of energy sheep get for every grass patch eaten
reproSheep <- 4 # probability in % of a sheep reproducing at each time step
numSheep <- nSheep # keep track of how many sheep there are

# Wolf settings
nWolf <- 50 # initial wolf population size
gainFoodWolf <- 20 # amount of energy wolves get for every sheep eaten
reproWolf <- 5 # probability in % of a wolf reproducing at each time step
numWolves <- nWolf # keep track of how many wolves there is

# torus = TRUE # just for reminder, to be used in the movement functions (e.g., fd())


## Setup
# Create the world
grass <- createWorld(minPxcor = -25, maxPxcor = 25, minPycor = -25, maxPycor = 25)

# If grassOn is TRUE, assign grass and countdown values to patches
# Because there are multiple patches variables, a NLworldStack is needed
# If grassOn is TRUE, the grass grows and the sheep eat it, if FALSE, the sheep don't need to eat
if(grassOn == TRUE){
  # Initialize patch values (grass and countdown) at random
  grassVal <- sample(c(0,1), size = NLcount(patches(grass)), replace = TRUE) # 0 or 1 (i.e., green or brown in the NetLogo model)
  grass <- NLset(world = grass, agents = patches(grass), val = grassVal)
  countdown <- grass # countdown is a new NLworld with the same extent as grass
  countdownVal <- runif(n = NLcount(patches(grass)), min = 0, max = grassTGrowth) # grass grow clock
  countdown <- NLset(world = countdown, agents = patches(countdown), val = countdownVal)
  field <- stackWorlds(grass, countdown)

}
# When no patches values are used, using grass, countdown or field as the world argument required by a function does not change anything
# because they all have the same extent and number of patches
# When patches values are used (e.g., when the sheep eat the grass), use only field as the world argument for the functions
# which update and retrieve the patches values
# When field is updated, the values on the individual NLworld grass and countdown are not updated, only the layers in field are

# Create the sheep
sheep <- createTurtles(n = nSheep, coords = randomXYcor(world = grass, n = nSheep), breed = "aSheep", color = rep("red", nSheep))
# Add the energy variable
sheep <- turtlesOwn(turtles = sheep, tVar = "energy", tVal = runif(n = nSheep, min = 0, max = 2 * gainFoodSheep))

# Create the wolves
wolves <- createTurtles(n = nWolf, coords = randomXYcor(world = grass, n = nWolf), breed = "wolf", color = rep("black", nWolf))
# Add the energy variable
wolves <- turtlesOwn(turtles = wolves, tVar = "energy", tVal = runif(n = nWolf, min = 0, max = 2 * gainFoodWolf))

# Initialize the count of grass
if(grassOn == TRUE){
  pGreen <- NLwith(world = field, var = "grass", agents = patches(field), val = 1) # patches equal to 1 (green)
  numGreen <- NLcount(pGreen)
}

# # Visualize the world
# if(grassOn == TRUE){
#   plot(world2raster(field)[[1]])
#   points(turtles2spdf(sheep), pch = 16, col = "red")
#   points(turtles2spdf(wolves), pch = 16, col = "black")

#   points(turtles2spdf(sheep), pch = 16, col = "red")
#   points(turtles2spdf(wolves), pch = 16, col = "black")
# }


## Functions used in the go procedure
# Always return the object updated by the function
# When only one type of input is permitted (e.g., only sheep or only wolves), the function does not need to express arguments
# When a function can be used by both sheep and wolves, the argument "turtles" must be used when building the function
# and be replaced by either sheep or wolves when calling the function
